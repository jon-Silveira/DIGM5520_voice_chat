//How To Create A Video Chat App With WebRTC - Web Dev Simplified
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvlyzDZDEq4&t
Attempted fix and update - https://github.com/js12lh/DIGM5520_voice_chat/tree/main/1%20Peerjs

This tutorial is one of the most popular youtube tutorials on creating video chat applications. 
This tutorial was my first introduction to web and browser-based communications. In the tutorial, 
the video chat application worked flawlessly each user can join a room through a browser, as they 
join their video feed is added into the frame. Though in implementation there were plenty of issues.
The application uses a socket.io server to exchange peer.js information. Peer.js is a wrapper for 
WebRTC that simplifies the information exchange process. The information exchange allows for the 
users to connect to each otherâ€™s browsers directly, an additional server is no longer necessary 
after the connection is established. The benefit of this example is that the can add as many 
individual clients as you need with performance loss. I was not able to test that capability
due to several issues with the library, this was documented in the issue section of peerjs GitHub. 
It appears that the last line in the library was incorrect and did not link to assisting pages properly.

answer found at https://github.com/peers/peerjs/issues/721

Unfortunately, regardless of this fix, peerjs still does not work. The browser console does not error.
Though there are moments when it connects after refreshing hundreds of times. I attempted to debug
the application using socket.io the information exchange occurs but it appears that the peerjs
library is the issue. Initially, I thought it was the configuration of peerjs STUN/ TURN servers 
as there were multiple issues posted on GitHub of other STUN/TURN servers that were not working.
